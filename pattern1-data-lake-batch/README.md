# Azure Synapse Data Lake Demo Environment ( Pattern 1)


## Prerequisites

* An active Azure subscription.
* An active DevOps account to use the Azure pipelines to deploy the resources.
* Service Principal has to be created and should be given Owner access over subscription, so that it can create new resource group and resources during the deployment. 
If "Owner" access can't be given, then assign it to a custom role which has access to the following:

  Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/
* [create a Azure Resource Manager service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#create-a-service-connection) from the Azure DevOps pipeline to connect the Azure subscription. 
* [create a github service connectoon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#github-service-connection) to connect to the github repo.

## Deployment Steps

1. clone the repo: https://github.com/Azure/fta-Catalytics.git
2. change the configuration file: ./config-infra-dev.yml

  - location: eastus 
  - prefix: fasthack 
  - postfix: pt2
  - environment: dev
  - objectID: '<< object ID of the service principal'
  - ado_service_connection_rg: Azure-ARM-Dev-SAPA
  - gihub_repo_name: "Azure/fta-Catalytics"

3. Go to the Azure DevOps and map the yml file from the repo

## Post Deployment
   1. Add your account as the synapse workspace admin. Otherwise, you will not be able to see the pipelines and the other components when you open the synapse workspace. Synapse workspace > Access Control -> add your logged in account as "Synapse Administrator"
   2. Run the master pipleine from the Azure synapse pipeline. Provide the required parameter Date to current date "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
